We can restore our file from last commited file.
=>Command
	eg.) git checkout   -- <File name>

We can give option for selection all file
=>Command
	eg.) git checkout  -- .


But what if we commited and want to get last commited file. [Means we want exact files that we have in last commit. ]

First get commit id you want to get.
	1) git log
		it will give list of logs with commited id and many more information.
		and then copy commit id .
	2) git revert <commited id>

	We can provide -n option for not commiting. it will keep in stage area.
	
	3) git revert -n  <commited id>
		and then commit your changes.	
	
We can also travel time hahaha. we can go back to a particular commit. and make those chanes undo. [means delete the commits]
	1) git reset --hard <commited id>

Javascript objects
	in javascript every thing is an objects.
	Object is a collection of properties. 
	and peoperties is association between a key and value. and a property value can be a function.
	aslo objects are predefined in the browser so we can define our own objects.
	
	eg.)var obj1 ={ name : "Dishant" , born : 1999 }
	eg.)var objWithFunction = { name : "Dishant" , born : 1999 , age : function() {  return date.year - this.born }  }


objects has properties which inherited from parent object so we can access methos in our objects.

	eg.)obj1.hasOwnProperty('<property name>')

We can create objects using constructor function.
	
	eg.) function Car(name,born){
		this.name = name
		this.born = born
	       }
	
	      var obj1 = new Car( "Dishant" , 1999 )

objects are passed their references when we initialize new objects from another object.

	eg.) var obj1 = { name : "Dishant" }
	       var obj2 =  obj1
	
	       if(obj1==obj2){
		console.log("true same")
	       }
